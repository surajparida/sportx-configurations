  ## Eureka server enters self-preservation mode if the actual number of heartbeats in last minute is less than
  ## the expected number of heartbeats per minute.

# If clients = N, renewal-percent-threshold is 0.85
# Heartbeats in 1 minute = 60 / lease-renewal-interval-in-seconds = 60 / 30 = 2
# N instances / min = 2 * N
# Expected minimum heartbeats / min = 2 * N * 0.85
#   ==> 2 * N * 0.85 is calculated in every 15 minutes by default (i.e. renewal-threshold-update-interval-ms)
